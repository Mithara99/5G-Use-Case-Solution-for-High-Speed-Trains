# 5G-Use-Case-Solution-for-High-Speed-Trains

High Speed Train (HSTs) use case is an essential part of the overall 5G experience in many parts of the world. HST technology has already dominated several parts of the world including Asia and Europe, and the demand for communication service providers (CSPs) to support the delivery of 5G services on trains is growing by day. Dynamic spectrum sharing is a key feature in the high rate demands of the evolving communication technology. But, the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) method, which is majorly adapted in 4G, produces adjacent channel interference through high side lobes. In addition to that, HSTs suffer from very high interferences through neighboring nodes due to the Doppler effect caused by high speeds. As a solution to this scenario, this paper discusses an alternative frequency division multiplexing method, which is Resource Block Filtered-OFDM (RB-F-OFDM). The paper further elaborates on a mobile application that is designed to track specific HSTs with the RB-F-OFDM facility which will allow travelers to enjoy an interference-free journey with 5G.
